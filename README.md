## triki.com : Triangular combinatorial metrics for machine learning and automated reasoning in Wikipedia
	[Introduction] Wikipedia is a semantic resource of inequal quality and inferences can be made from measures.
	[Methods] We develop triangular combinatorial metrics to make better automated reasoning in Wikipedia.
	[Results] Our results demonstrate how geometrical features can be used in use cases and applications of machine learning and automated reasoning.
	[Discussion] We discuss limitations and recommendations for future geometrical researches in conceptual spaces.

[Keywords] Wikipedia ; triangular metrics ; combinatorics ; automated Reasoning ; machine learning.
